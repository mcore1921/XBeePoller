To auto-generate web pages:

1) Have a web server that you can use ssh-copy-id to enable password-less
   upload via scp.  (Oh, and do actually do the ssh-copy-id thing.)
2) Update thermHtmlGenWork.sh.  You'll probably need to override the
   $GENDIR and $DESTSSH variables.  You'll probably also want to copy
   the script somewhere else, so that later git pulls don't conflict.  
   I recommend making a ~/bin directory and putting it there.
3) Add thermHtmlGenWork.sh to your crontab.  Something like this:
*/15 * * * * /home/mcore/bin/thermHtmlGenWork.sh
   Be sure to update the directory if you make a copy
4) Update the template html files to match your web address and naming
   scheme, so that the links at the bottom of the page are appropriate.
5) Upload the dygraph javascript file to your server.

That's it!
