Short Answer at the top, lots of notes down below.

---------------------------

To configure the controller:
X-CTU application, some USB programmer thing
Modem Type XB24-ZB
Modem FW version 21A7
Zigbee Coordinator API
Set the PAN ID
Adjust SP (specified in hex, 10ms units) and SN (multiplier for SP) so that
  it exceeds the wake delay on the remotes.
A 12 minute delay is good, which would be SP=0x7D0 (2000), SN=0x24 (36)
  (20sec x 36 = 720, 12 minutes)

---------------------------

To configure the remote stations:
Be sure to replace the PANID with your desired ID!

ATID<PANID>
ATDH0
ATDL0
ATD02
ATD12
ATSM4
ATSP9C4
ATSN6
ATIRFA
ATST1388
ATWR

If it isn't connecting in time, try doubling the alive time per poll
ATST2710  (though it seems the SP/SN on the coordinator is better answer...)

---------------------------

To configure a router XBee to be the digital I/O sampler
for this application:

In all instances below, replace <id> with the PAN ID#

This sequence sets up the device to send periodic samples
to the coordinator (ADTDH0/ATDL0). Upon waking from sleep /
powering up, it will attempt to locate the coordinator (ATJV1).
It will then send samples at a rate of one per 0x03E8 (1000) 
milliseconds. 

ATID<id>
ATDH0
ATDL0
ATJV1
ATD02
ATD12
ATIR3E8
ATWR


This sequence sets up the device to send periodic samples
to the coordinator (ADTDH0/ATDL0). Upon waking from sleep /
powering up, it will attempt to locate the coordinator (ATJV1).
It will then wake every 5 seconds (ATSP1F4).  Every wake it will
wait for 65ms (ATWH41), then do I/O samples at a rate of one per 
50ms (ATIR32) until the ST timer expires at 320ms (ATST140).
Also set SN and SO to defaults (ATSN1, ATSO0)

ATID<id>
ATDH0
ATDL0
ATJV1
ATD02
ATD12
ATSM4
ATSP1F4
ATWH41

ATWR


This sequence is similar to above, with different parameters.
Sleep period 5 seconds (ATSP1F4).  On every wake, 
wait is still 65ms (ATWH41), then I/O at a rate of one per 
5ms (ATIR5) until the ST timer expires at 260ms (ATST57).
Also set SN and SO to defaults (ATSN1, ATSO0)

ATID<id>

Now a trial for use in the house project.
fSleep period is 2:30 (150 sec).  This is achieved with 6 25-sec
periods (ATSP9C4, ATSN6).  Readings are then sent back at 4hz
(ATIRFA).  Then have the device stay awake for 5 seconds before
returning to sleep (ATST1388) - but this is the default, so we 
will just leave it.  Note ATJV is returned to 0 - we 
always want to run on the specified ID.

ATID<id>
ATDH0
ATDL0
ATD02
ATD12
ATSM4
ATSP9C4
ATSN6
ATIRFA
ATST1388
ATWR



0x32 = 50ms
0x3C = 60ms
0x41 = 65ms
0x1F4 = 500 (note ATSP implicitly adds 10x)
0x140 = 320 (65 for WH, 250 for 5 samples, 5 to grow on)
0x3E8 = 1000

Here is the current configuration for the house project:
ATID27
ATDH0
ATDL0
ATD02
ATD12
ATSM4
ATSP9C4
ATSN6
ATIRFA
ATST1388
