So you want to make a new config?  Here's the overview if you're using 
a Raspberry Pi 2

1) Configure an XBee in API mode.  See XBeeConfig.txt.  Hook it up to the 
   RPI2 - +3.3v, ground, TXD, and RXD.  Configure raspberry pi so the 
   TXD/RXD pins aren't providing a terminal, but are instead available 
   as a /dev/tty.  I'm pretty sure raspi-config can do this.
2) Build the code.  See NewRpiConfig.txt for a list of packages you'll need.  
   Keep running Make and figure out the dependencies - everything's in 
   there but the Makefile isn't very advanced.
3) Make a new MySQL database and set it up with the config.  See SQLNotes.txt.
4) Set up a ~/.XBeeThermPollerConfig/XBeeThermPollerConfig file.  
   Example below.
5) Set up at least one remote station for testing.  Again see XBeeConfig.txt.
6) Run thermPoller --port=/dev/ttyXXXX, replacing XXXX for the right port.  
   On Raspberry Pi, it's typically /dev/ttyAMA0.
   You can also set the default port in the config file so you don't have
   to pass it as an arg. Add the following:
:PROCESS_CONFIG
PORTNAME /dev/ttyAMA0
7) Calibrate the remote station.  See Calibration.txt for details.
8) Set up cron job for webpage creation. See htmlgen/README for details.
9) Set up cron job for battery failure notification.  See battmail/README
   for details.
