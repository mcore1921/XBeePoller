So you want to make a new config?  Here's the overview if you're using 
a Raspberry Pi 2

1) Set up your Rpi2.  See NewRpiConfig.txt for detailed instructions.
2) Set up a database.  Use the default names if you don't want to 
   figure out the config files.

From shell:
> mysql -u root -p

Now, inside mysql:
>create database therm;
>create user 'xbtherm'@'localhost' identified by 'therm';
>grant all privileges on therm.* to 'xbtherm'@'%';
>quit

3) Get this repo onto the rpi2.
4) Build the code.
> make; cd htmlgen; make; cd ../battmail; make

5) Install the code.  You may need to sudo these...
> ./install.sh install <username to run the service as>
> cd htmlgen; ./install.sh install <prefix for web pages>
> cd ../battmail; ./install.sh install

6) Set up the config files.  These are in /etc/XBeeThermClient.

That's the RPi part.  For the hardware part:
1) Configure an XBee in API mode using X-CTU.  Also set a PanID at this time.
   This is the ID that allows multiple ZigBee networks in the same area;
   just choose one at random, but be sure to set the same one for all your
   units.
2) Set up at least one remote station for testing.  You can use router
   or endpoint firmware - easiest to just leave the default firmware on
   your XBee (which is router).  The only parameter you need to set is the
   PAN ID.  You can do this directly from the RPI by connecting the remote
   to the configuration you set in (1) and doing the following:
   2a) In one shell, run:
       cat -A /dev/ttyAMA0
   2b) In a second shell, run the following.  Don't wait more than ~10
       seconds between each step or the XBee will switch back to non-config
       mode.
       > echo -ne "+++" > /dev/ttyAMA0
       After about a second you should see "OK" printed to the first shell
       Then, in the second shell, run the following, subbing your pan ID
       (in hex) for the XX:
       > echo -ne "ATIDXX\r\nATID\r\n" > /dev/ttyAMA0
       YOu should see an "OK" and then an echo back of the ID you set.
       Lastly, write the ID config to non-volatile memory:
       > echo -ne "ATWR\r\n" > /dev/ttyAMA0
       Now you can pop out the XBee and move on
3) Calibrate the remote station.  See Calibration.txt for details.
