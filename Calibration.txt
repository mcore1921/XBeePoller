Short answer:

To update calibration, change the sensors table in the mysql
database.  Do something like:
mysql> update sensors set calibration = 0.98 where id = 1;

Also, if you want the watch file to have correct calibrations,
add something like this to your XBeeThermPollerConfig, where
the mac matches the mac of the associated XBee and the value is
a from below.

Formula for gain (solving for a, C=degrees celsius, x=analog reading):
  a = C/(0.1173x - 50)


Detailed calibration overview:

Calibration scalar is applied in mysql scripts as part of conversion
from raw sample readings (readings table) to averaged readings
(thermdata table).  The formula, for an analog value X, is:
celsius = ((x*1000.0/1023.0*1.2)-500)*0.1*cal_scalar

From the TMP36 datasheet, we expect 10 mvDC of signal for each degree C.

The XBee ADC is against a fixed 1.2v internal reference, so saturated
on that input would be 1.2v.  It's a 10-bit ADC, so 0=0 and 1023 = max.
So, to find the volts for a value x from the ADC:
   mV = (x*1000/1023*1.2)
Multiply by 1000/1023 to normalize for the 10-bit ADC, and the resulting
value is 1000 * a percentage of the reference voltage of 1.2v.
Multiply by 1.2 and you have a raw voltage reading, in mV.
The TMP36's offset is such that at 500mV it is 0 degrees C.
The TMP36's gain is 10mV per degree C.
So:
   C = (mv-500)*0.1
   C = ((x*1000/1023*1.2)-500)*0.1
If we assume that the offset doesn't need calibration (no reason
to assume this, the datasheet doesn't appear to give guidance)
then we can simply add a gain calibration a thusly:
   C = ((x*1000/1023*1.2)-500)*0.1*a
I don't think this is the best way to do things, but at least it will
cause all the sensors to agree at typical room temperature.

The calibration scalar is stored in the mysql sensors table.  It's tied
to the MAC of the XBee on a board.  Logically it would be better tied
to the board itself, as that's what is being calibrated, but we don't
have enough information to know what that is.
