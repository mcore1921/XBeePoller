To auto-send emails when a sensor (or the base station) go unresponsive:

Note: by default, notifications go out every 2 hours, and let you know 
  if anything hasn't talked for 2 hours.  This can all be tweaked with 
  the crontab schedule and with command-line args - run battmail with 
  no args for usage.
1) Build battmail.  It's in the battmail subdir.
2) Set up a ~/.XBeeThermPollerConfig/BattMail file.  Example and more
       detail below.
3) Add this line to crontab
0 */2 * * * <full_path_to_battmail_executable> <email@addr.com> >> /dev/null
4) You can add --cc <email@addr.com> between the battmail executable
   and the target email address to add a cc.  (Maybe more than one?)
5) I made an app-specific authentication for my gmail account, which
   seems to work...

Example BattMail config file:
:MAIL_CONFIG
USERNAME foobar@gmail.com
PASSWORD autogenbygoogleapppasswordgenthingie
SERVER smtp://smtp.gmail.com:587
